# SteakCoins


**Initial ideas to expand the platform include**



1. Gain Digital Assets
    1. Convert SteakCoins to NFT’s via atomic swap of X tokens for Y NFT
        1. In a decentralized manner incent 3rd part meat artists by enabling atomic swaps for Custom Meat NFT’s of celebrities dressed in Meat. After all, people[ go GaGa to meat celebrities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga%27s_meat_dress).
            1. Bondly.finance may be a good partner here
            2. Need alternates
2. Meat.Finance
    2. Ask to Collaborate with Unibar.Exchange to make a Meat-SushiSwap pool
        2. Mingo integration to unibar may be a good path to hold SteakCoin and uniswap bridge???
3. Coupon Conversion
    3. Collaborate with Brands like @Steak_umm to publish a conversion rate for retweets/mentions to “steakcoin” SteakCoins
    4. Sign Up Meat Brands to the Coupon Bureau for automated SteakCoin conversions at the register.
        3. Maybe every token gets a unique code?

Extending Viral Token to a Repeatable Business



1. Simple Rule Deployment based on Form
    1. Mint based on Tweet, Retweet or Reply
    2. Send (CryptoTransfer) amount based on #hashtag
    3. Send (CryptoTransfer) amount based on #hashtag
    4. Vote/Lock for [twitter polls](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/poll)
        1. Vote + Comment (that sends tokens to an escrow) Locks tokens to a pool, whichever vote wins distributes locked tokens to winning poll + question asker 50/50
            1. If a poll has “option a” and “option b” and option a has 1000 votes and 1000 tokens and option b has 2000 votes and 2000 tokens, the tokens staked to option a would be distributed equally to option b voters based on their known accounts. Option a voters would lose their tokens in escrow.
            2. May need to keep it formulaic for incentive
2. Advanced rules for $$
    5. Economic Parameters
        2. Ex. Must hold > or &lt; of a token or $hbar to participate in interaction. Participants don’t earn tokens until they have $10 in hbar.
    6. Burn amount based on _________
